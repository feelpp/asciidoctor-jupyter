= The Lorenz Differential Equations
:jupyter-language-name: python
:jupyter-language-version: 3.7.8
:url-ipywidgets: https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Before we start, we import some preliminary libraries.
We will also import (below) the accompanying `lorenz.py` file,
which contains the actual solver and plotting routine.

[source,python]
----
%matplotlib inline
from ipywidgets import interactive, fixed
----

We explore the Lorenz system of differential equations:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} & = \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy
\end{aligned}
++++

Let's change (stem:[\sigma], stem:[\beta], stem:[\rho]) with {url-ipywidgets}[ipywidgets] and examine the trajectories.

[source,python]
----
from lorenz import solve_lorenz
w=interactive(solve_lorenz,sigma=(0.0,60.0),rho=(0.0,50.0))
w
----

For the default set of parameters, we see the trajectories swirling around two points, called attractors.

The object returned by `interactive` is a `Widget` object and it has attributes that contain the current result and arguments:

[source,python]
----
t, x_t = w.result
----

[source,python]
----
w.kwargs
